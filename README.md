# Lucky-Card-Game

Lucky Card Game is a turn-based, poker-inspired card game that is designed for players who’d enjoy a blend of luck and strategy within their gameplay. The core objective is to challenge players to maximize their scores by forming matching pairs from a shuffled 52-card deck while adapting to progressively more difficult rounds. Instead of placing bets, additional special cards will be introduced—Joker and Support cards, which will aid the player in getting additional points within the gameplay. It’s suitable for people of all ages that are interested in how poker works, or if they’re just looking for a quick, casual game of poker and test their luck.
